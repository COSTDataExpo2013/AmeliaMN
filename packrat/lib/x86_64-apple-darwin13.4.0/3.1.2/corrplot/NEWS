CHANGES
  *  Add html vignette, which was generated from markdown file by knitr.
  *  In corrplot(), remove parameter "zoom", add "is.corr"; now it is more convenient to
     visualize  non-correlation matrix. Parameter "addtextlabel" was renamed as "tl.pos", 
     and "addcolorlabel" was renamed as "cl.pos".
