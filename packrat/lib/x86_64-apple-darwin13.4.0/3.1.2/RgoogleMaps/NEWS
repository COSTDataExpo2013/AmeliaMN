Changes in Version 1.2.0.3

  o Added full support for Openstreetmap (OSM) tiles
    All functions should work properly with both Google and OSM tiles.


Changes in Version 1.2.0.2

  o Added function ColorMap, which plots levels of a Variable in a Colour-Coded Map

Changes in Version 1.2.0

  o As of version: 1.2.0, RgoogleMaps only offers support for png files, no more jpeg. 
    The maintenance of the jpg ReadImages library has become too tedious, so I removed all dependencies.
