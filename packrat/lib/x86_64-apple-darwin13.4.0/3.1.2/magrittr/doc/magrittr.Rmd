*This version: May, 2014. Stefan Milton Bache* 

This introduction to *the magrittr* (to be pronounced
with a sophisticated french accent) will be short(*ish*) and to the point; 
as is the package itself. *magrittr* has two aims: to decrease development time 
and to improve readability and maintainability of code. Or even shortr: to make
your code smokin' (puff puff)!

To archive its humble aims, *magrittr* (remember the accent) provides a new 
"pipe"-like operator, `%>%`, with which you may pipe a value forward into an 
expression or function call; something along the lines of ` x %>% f `, rather
than ` f(x)`. This is not an unknown feature
elsewhere; a prime example is the `|>` operator used extensively in `F#`
(to say the least) and indeed this -- along with Unix pipes -- served as a 
motivation for developing the magrittr package.

At first encounter, you may wonder whether such an operator can really 
be all that beneficial; but as you may notice, it semantically changes your 
code in a way that makes it more intuitive to both read and write.

Consider the following example, in which the `airquality` dataset shipped with
R is aggregated by week. We also print the first 3 rows for exposition.
```{r}
library(magrittr)

weekly <-
  airquality %>% 
  transform(Date = paste(1973, Month, Day, sep = "-") %>% as.Date) %>% 
  aggregate(. ~ Date %>% format("%W"), ., mean)

weekly %>% head(3)
```
We start with the value `airquality` (a `data.frame`). Then based on this, we 
make the "transformation" of adding a `Date` column using month, day and 
year (the year can be found in the dataset's documentation). Then we 
aggregate the data by week (which is a "format" of the date) using `mean`
as aggregator. Note how the code is arranged in the logical
order of how you think about the task: data->transform->aggregate.
A horrific alternative would be to write
```{r}
weekly <- aggregate(. ~ format(Date, "%W"), transform(airquality, 
  Date = as.Date(paste(1973, Month, Day, sep = "-"))), mean)

head(weekly, 3)
```
There is a lot more clutter with parentheses, and the mental task of deciphering
the code is more challenging---in particular if you did not write it yourself.
Note how even the extraction of few rows has a semantic appeal in the
first example over the second, even though none of them are hard to understand.
Granted: you may make the second example better, perhaps throw in a few temporary
variables (which is often avoided to some degree when using *magrittr*),
but one often sees cluttered lines like the ones presented. 

And here is another selling point. Suppose I want to quickly go a step further 
and extract a subset somewhere in the process. Simply add a few steps to the 
chain:
```{r}
windy.weeks <-
  airquality %>% 
  transform(Date = paste(1973, Month, Day, sep = "-") %>% as.Date) %>% 
  aggregate(. ~ Date %>% format("%W"), ., mean) %>%
  subset(Wind > 12, c(Ozone, Solar.R, Wind)) %>% 
  print

```
I will refrain from making the alternative code even messier, but it should be 
clear that adding steps in a *magrittr* chain is simpler than working ones
way through a labyrinth of parentheses.

The combined example shows a few neat features of the pipe (which it is not):

1. By default the left-hand side (LHS) will be *piped in* as the first argument of 
the function appearing on the right-hand side (RHS). This is the case in the 
`transform` expression.
2. It may be used in a nested fashion, e.g. appearing in expressions within 
arguments. This is used in the date conversion (Note how the "pronunciation"
of e.g. `"2014-02-01" %>% as.Date` is more pleasant than is `as.Date("2014-02-01")`).
3. When the LHS is needed at a position other than the first, one can use
the dot,`'.'`, as placeholder. This is used in the `aggregate` expression.
4. The dot in e.g. a formula is *not* confused with a placeholder, which is
utilized in the `aggregate` expression.
5. Whenever only *one* argument is needed, the LHS, then one can omit the
empty parentheses. This is used in the call to `print` (which also returns its
argument). Here, `LHS %>% print()`, or even `LHS %>% print(.)` would also work.

One feature, which was not utilized above is piping into *anonymous functions*.
This is also possible, e.g.
```{r}
windy.weeks %>%
(function(x) rbind(x %>% head(1), x %>% tail(1)))
```
Here the right-hand side is enclosed in parentheses, which is not strictly 
necessary, but advised. Whenever the RHS is parenthesized, is evaluated before
the piping operation is carried out, i.e., one could do:
```{r}
1:10 %>% (substitute(f(), list(f = sum)))
```

To summarize the important features:

1. Piping defaults to first-argument placement.
2. Using a dot as placeholder allows you to use the LHS anywhere on the 
  right-hand side.
3. You may omit parentheses when only the LHS is needed as argument.
4. You can use anonymous functions.
5. You can parenthesize the right-hand side if this itself evaluates to the
relevant call or function.

In addition to the `%>%`-operator, *magrittr* provides some aliases for other
operators which make operations such as addition or multiplication fit well 
into the *magrittr*-syntax. As an example, consider:
```{r}
rnorm(1000)    %>%
multiply_by(5) %>%
add(5)         %>%
function(x) 
  cat("Mean:",     x %>% mean, 
      "Variance:", x %>% var,  "\n")

```
which could be written in more compact form as
```{r, results = 'hide'}
rnorm(100) %>% `*`(5) %>% `+`(5) %>% 
function(x) cat("Mean:", x %>% mean, "Variance:", x %>% var,  "\n")
```
To see a list of the aliases, execute e.g. `?multiply_by`. For more
examples of `%>%` in use, see the development page:
